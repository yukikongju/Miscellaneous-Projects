# Troubleshoot

- US organic is way to big => 80% of installs are Organic?
- [X] Sanity check: add known networks + organic and see if the number of installs resemble to what we see on appsflyer


**Ideas**

- Can we use `perc_diff` to see whether we are confident in
  this number?
- Can we use `perc_diff` to make confidence intervals
