# LTV Predictions

## What is Customer Life Time Value (LTV)

LTV represents the overall revenue a business can anticipate generating from
an individual throughout their relationship. LTV can be broken down in
2 parts:
- realized revenue: the amount of money a customer has already spent with the business
- unrealized revenue: the amount of money we expect a customer to generate in
  the future

## Calculating LTV

- Method 1: `LTV = Avg revenue per customer * Customer Lifetime (avg renewal rate)`
- Method 2: `LTV = Avg revenue per customer / churn rate within period`
- Method 3: `LTV = (Avg revenue per customer * Gross Margin %) / revenue churn rate`
