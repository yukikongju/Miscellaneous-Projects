# Notes

**TODOs**

- [ ] [Henry] P0: Install vs Trial vs paid vs renewal dates => look at distribution
      of paid occuring after 60 days. These conversions won't be taken into
      account in the current T2P, so we can use the distribution to find a
      multiplier, which we can use to multiply the trials.

**Sub-Tasks Ideas**

- [Predicting Users Renewal Rate]
    * based off in-app events within period (first day)
    * based off time from install to trial => do user who take the trial faster pay/renew more?
