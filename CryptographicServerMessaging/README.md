# Cryptographic Server Messaging

**Goal of the project**

Create a system where users can send virtual coins to other users. The system 
should show a dashboard of all transactions made. The system should be able 
to catch a user that tries to change the money.

At the begining, users mine some coins. After a while, mining stops and users 
try to trade.
