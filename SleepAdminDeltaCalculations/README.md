# Sleep Admin Delta Calculations for Brief

In the brief, given (1) power (2) significance level alpha (3) reach and (4) 
conversion rate, we would like to estimate:
- The timeline needed to complete the experiment -> should rely on 'Experiment Sizing Tradeoffs' for initial baseline and change only if relative deltas are too big
- The absolute and relative delta needed to call the experiment a win.


This project has two sections:
1. Given [power, alpha, reach and conversion], generate absolute and relative 
   deltas for different timeline (week 1 to week 15)
2. Given [power, alpha, reach and conversion], find timeline needed for [5%-20%] 
   relative lift
