# Guided Content Recommender

Making an Embedding for Guided content based on text. Trying to implement 
the following:

**Document to Vector Embedding**

- Doc2Vec
- Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
- Language Agnostic Sentence Representation (LASER)
- Sentence BERT
- T5 Embedding
- InferSent (?)

**Using word Embedding to create a document embedding**

- Method 1: Average Word Embedding
    * compute the average vector of all words embeddings, weighted by their 
      importance using TF-IDF

**How to measure embedding performance?**
