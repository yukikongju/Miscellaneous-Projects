# Matrix Multiplication Optimization with FP

[link](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/16-recursive-data-types/matexpr/)

We want to exploit matrix multiplication properties (commutativity) to make matrix multiplication faster. We want to perform scalar multiplication first. We will then compare the time it takes with and without optimization.

Cases:
- [ ] X
- [ ] aX
- [ ] (aX)b => (ab)X
- [ ] (Xa)(bY) => ((ab)X)Y
- [ ] aX + aY = a(X+Y) = Xa + Ya
