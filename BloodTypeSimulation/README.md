# Blood Type Simulation

Simulating blood type proportion over the years

## The Problem

According to the ABO blood group system, there are 4 distincts group (A, B, AB 
or O) and a rhesus type (either positive or negative). Since the A/B allele are
codominant over O type and positive is dominant over negative, we can determine
the blood of an individual given the blood of its parents.

The goal of this experiment is to understand how the blood type distribution 
will vary over the year through simulation. We will test several experiments, 
each having their own assumptions:

**Simulation 1**

- each newborn is generated by taking two random parents from the current distribution 
- each individual dies after a randomly generated time that follows a poisson distribution. we assume that individual from different type have the same expected longevity 
- each individual may or not procreate. Once the individual procreates, the odds that they have another child diminishes by an exponential rate


## Classes

- [ ] Individual
- [ ] Population
    - Blood type distribution
    - number of males, females individuals
