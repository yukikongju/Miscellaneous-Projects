# Blood Type Simulation

Simulating blood type proportion over the years

## The Problem

According to the ABO blood group system, there are 4 distincts group (A, B, AB 
or O) and a rhesus type (either positive or negative). Since the A/B allele are
codominant over O type and positive is dominant over negative, we can determine
the blood of an individual given the blood of its parents.

The goal of this experiment is to understand how the blood type distribution 
will vary over the year through simulation. We will test several experiments, 
each having their own assumptions:

**Simulation 1**

- each newborn is generated by taking two random parents from the current distribution 
- each individual dies after a randomly generated time that follows a poisson distribution. we assume that individual from different type have the same expected longevity 
- each individual may or not procreate. Once the individual procreates, the odds that they have another child diminishes by an exponential rate

## How to run

1. `make clean`
2. `make`
3. `./project`

## TODOs

- [X] init simulation with individuals
- [X] create hashmap class with `template` for generic types: CountDict; PercDict
- [X] make `LinkedList` for females and males
- [X] In `Count`: reformat `print` so that it show count and (perc )
- [.] run simulation for n steps: generate individual based on parent 
	- every time steps: there are k newborns (k is randomly generated)
	- assumption: nobody dies, individual can start to mate as soon as they are born
	- assumption: when parent mates, we put them at the end of the list
	- [X] In `individual`: `initType` based on parents
	- [ ] In `population`: `runSimulation`: find mom and dad from list of males and females
- [ ] generate several simulation in `main`
