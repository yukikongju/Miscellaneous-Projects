# Q1 - How can we use social network analysis for sport analytics

    Player Performance Analysis:
        How do individual players or athletes perform within a team network?
        Who are the key players in terms of passing, scoring, or other performance metrics?
        How does a player's position in the network affect their performance?

    Team Dynamics:
        What is the overall connectivity or cohesiveness of a team during a game?
        How do passing or communication patterns evolve over the course of a game or season?
        Are there clusters or subgroups of players who tend to work closely together?

    Opponent Analysis:
        What are the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent's network structure?
        Can we identify patterns in the opponent's playstyle or strategy based on network analysis?

    Tactical Insights:
        How do different tactics or strategies affect the team's network structure?
        What are the optimal passing or positional strategies to maximize team performance?
        How does the network structure change when transitioning between offensive and defensive phases of play?

    Injury Risk Assessment:
        Can network analysis help identify players at a higher risk of injury based on their network behavior (e.g., overuse or abnormal movement patterns)?
        Are there correlations between network metrics and injury rates?

    Player Transfers and Recruitment:
        How might a new player integrate into an existing team's network, and what impact will they have on team dynamics?
        What are the best strategies for recruiting players based on network analysis of their performance in other teams?

    Fan Engagement and Marketing:
        How can network analysis be used to engage fans and enhance the viewing experience (e.g., visualizing passing networks during a live broadcast)?
        Which player interactions generate the most fan interest and social media engagement?

    Performance Optimization:
        How can team and player performance be optimized by adjusting network-based strategies (e.g., passing patterns or player positioning)?
        What are the key performance indicators that can be improved through network analysis?

    Game Outcome Prediction:
        Can network analysis metrics be used to predict game outcomes or team performance in the future?

    Player Development:
        How can network analysis aid in the identification of young talent and in tracking their development over time?
        What network-based coaching strategies can help improve individual and team performance?

    In-Game Decision Making:
        How can real-time network analysis assist coaches in making in-game decisions, such as substitutions or tactical adjustments?

    Fan Loyalty and Player Connections:
        How can network analysis be used to measure fan loyalty and the strength of connections between fans and players on social media and other platforms?
