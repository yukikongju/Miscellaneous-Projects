# Monte Carlo - Coins Flips

# Simulations

**Coin Flips (Completed)**

Run n simulations of m coin flips. Calculate mean and standard deviation. 
This is the monte carlo simulation for the binomial distribution.

**Experiments (in progress)**

- What is the true/false positive rate of our early peaking calls for a given 
  experiment
- If we decide to make the early peaking call, what should be the pvalue accepted?


**Quaterly Holdback**



**Friendship Paradox**

- In a social network, why do your friend are more likely to have more friends than you 
- What if the number of friends follows: 
  (1) normal distribution
  (2) exponential
  (3) logarithmic

**pvalue Optimization**
