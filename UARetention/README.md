# UA Retention

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/s/I0cri)

**Context**

We are optimizing for paid rate in detriment of retention rate. 
What is the impact of retention given that most of our user base is coming 
from paid ads?

Parameters:
- lift weekly retention:
- lift in monthly retention:
- lift in yearly retention: 
- lift in paid rate:
- lift in renewal rate (yearly):

Opportunity cost: 
- RPU relative to change in retention

Notes:
- How does rates impact retention rate/renewal rate?
    * Cancellation rate
    * Retention rate
- What happened in our retention rate in the last year?

**What do we know**

In 2023:
- 90% of the users pay within a year from install BS start their 
  subscription in the first 21 days; 50% do so within 6.7 days
- Of the people that subscribed and asked for a refund, 90% of 
  them are doing so within the first 48 days; 50% do so within 
  9.4 days
- In March 2024, we had 800K installs. 32.89% of our users are paid, 67.11% are organic users
- According to Looker Studio, in March 2024, we spend 2.098M to get 30,716 users (56% ROAS)
- Users retention for paid users is 88% after one month, 48% after one year

**Formula**

- F = $/sub * num subscription + $/renewal * num renewals

- retention impacts the num users left after one year that we can reconvert
- paid rate impacts num subscription
- cancellation rate impacts num renewals
