Transportation models aim to describe the movement and distribution of entities (e.g., people, goods, information) within a system. Here are several types of transport models:

**Traffic Flow Models**

- Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) Model:
    * Macroscopic traffic flow model that represents traffic as a continuous fluid.

- Cellular Automaton Models:
    * Microscopic traffic models based on discrete entities representing vehicles and their movement.

- Greenshields Model:
    * Describes the relationship between traffic density and traffic flow, one of the earliest traffic flow models.

- METANET Model:
    * Considers both traffic and network dynamics to analyze the impact of incidents on urban traffic.

 **Network Flow Models**

- Transportation Network Models:
    * Mathematical models representing transportation networks and their flow patterns.

- Gravity Models:
    * Estimate the flow of goods or people between locations based on their mass and distance.

**Logistics and Supply Chain Models**

- Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP):
    * Optimization problem aiming to find the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles.

- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
    * Optimization problem where a salesman seeks the shortest route to visit a set of cities.

- Supply Chain Network Models:
    * Analyze the structure and dynamics of supply chain networks to optimize resource allocation.

**Public Transportation Models**

- Public Transit Assignment Models:
    * Allocate passengers to public transit routes and services in an urban environment.

- Transit Network Design Models:
    * Optimize the design and layout of public transit networks.

**Telecommunications and Information Flow Models**

- Network Routing Models:
    * Determine the optimal paths for information flow in computer networks.

- Data Flow Models:
    * Describe the movement of data within information systems.

**Fluid Transport Models**

- Navier-Stokes Equations:
    * Fundamental equations in fluid dynamics that describe the motion of fluids, applicable to air and water transport.

- Advection-Diffusion Equations:
    * Describe the transport of substances (e.g., pollutants) in fluid systems.
