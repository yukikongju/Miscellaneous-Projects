# Onboarding Chatbot

NLP Uses cases to explore:
- intent classification
- NER classification


Use Cases to Explore:
- [ ] What is your main goal when using BetterSleep?
- [ ] What is the user's habit? (what seems the most interesting)
- [ ] What content seems interesting (before bed)? (solve cold start problem) 
    + ask current UA content (nature sounds, voice content, theme, music, ...)
- [ ] What's your current sleep routine like? (bedtime/wake time, how much 
      time falling asleep, cafeine/activity/screens, ...)
- [ ] Other Qs: HAU, demographics (sex, age, occupation, city)

User Needs:
