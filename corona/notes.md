# Part 1 - Covid Genomic

1. downloading the corona virus genome
    a. [NIH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1798174254)
    b. vocabulary: nucleotides, codons, amino acid, protein; peptide, capsid
2. Data Exploring: size of conona virus
    a. size of corona virus with data compresssion: `zlib`, `lzma` => ~8Kb
    b. Kolmogorov Complexity => length of smallest computer program that produces output
    c. Central Dogma: translating base into codons ie amino acids
    d. Krebs Cycle => process that convert respiration into energy (ATP)
3. Data Exploration: can we check if corona is derived from HIV
    a. how to find capsid from genome => capsid: capsule of virus
    b. peptide: linear chain of 2-50 amino acids
    c. proteases
4. Protein Function
    a. three codons positions: P1, P2, P3; Wobble Position
    b. Negative selection principle: the less important parts change more 
	rapidly than the more important parts

## Part 2 - What's the diff between SARS-I and SARS-II

1. Protein Information with 
    a. `ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein` => 
    b. `uniprot.org/uniprot/`
2. Python Package: `nglview`
3. [Foldingathome](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/?lng=en)
